# donglab_workflows
Image registration workflows as part of Next Generation MORF BRAIN Initiative Project

Algorithms use GPU parallelization enabled by the pytorch library.

todo: 
finalize code into a series of scripts.
include instructions for setting up vertual env with all requirements


need:
required specifications for interfacing with necessary outputs.


# Daniel's plan
start with jupyter notebooks, then turn them into scripts to be run by other users on a cluster.

Functions will move to an importable library.

This is in the twardlab organization, but can be forked elsewhere.
